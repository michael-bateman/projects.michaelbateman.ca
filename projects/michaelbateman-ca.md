This is my personal website, which I made in 2016.  It was my first site that I ever made.  I did not use a framework for the first little while, then I used the w3 School's CSS which was absolutely horrible.  Then I made the big switch to go to Boostrap v3.3.6, which was good.  In the future, I am thinking of moving the whole site to Boostrap 4, which would be A LOT of work!
